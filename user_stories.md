# User Stories

This document contains the user stories that motivated the creation of the Hydra Plugins Working Group. One of our stated deliverables is a set of guidelines that, when adhered to, will satisfy these user stories.

## Definitions
  * **A plugin** is software that can be optionally installed into a Hydra product.
  * **The documentation** is the sum of documents, tutorials, etc. that explain the guidelines for developing plugins.
  * **A plugin developer** is one who is writing code for plugin.
  * **A hydra developer** is one who is writing code for any part of the hydra stack that may interact with a hydra plugin.
  * **An implementer** is one who installs and/or manages the installation of a product within the Hydra stack for production use.

As a plugin developer,
who is reading the documentation for developing plugins,
I know the expectations that the Hydra community will have of my plugin
so that my plugin is sufficiently documented,
and can be installed, configured, and used by others
with a known amount of effort.

```
As a plugin developer,
who is reading the documentation for developing plugins,
I know the interfaces and conventions within the Hydra stack that I must/should/may use
when developing my plugin.

```
As an implementer of Hydra,
I can expect that the installation and configuration of a plugins will be similar to other plugins
so that installing new plugins is a predictable process with minimal overhead.
